# Deep Learning Assignment 1

### Repo information
* This is a repo of assignment 1 for Master's [Deep Learning](https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/fwn/vak/show?code=WMAI017-05) Course at University of Groningen

### Instructions to run the code
* The neural network implemented from scratch using Numpy. The default parameters already give the best possible results. To list all the commandline options available run the following command.
```
python src/neural_net_scratch.py --help
```
* The neural network implemented using PyTorch. The default parameters already give the best possible results. To list all the commandline options available run the following command.
```
python src/neural_net_pytorch.py --help
```
* The [jupyter notebook](src/visualize_dataset.ipynb) can be used to visualize the distribution of the dataset

### Dependencies
